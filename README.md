# AI-Salary-Prediction
🚀 Software Developer Salary Prediction App
🔗 Built with Python, Streamlit, and Machine Learning

I developed a web application that predicts the annual salary of software developers based on their:

🌍 Country

🎓 Education level

💼 Years of experience

🔍 Key Features:
Interactive Prediction Tool using a trained ML regression model

Real-time currency conversion via API

Data Visualization: Salary trends by country and experience

Clean UI powered by Streamlit

📊 Data Source: Stack Overflow Developer Survey
🧠 Model Training: Scikit-learn, Label Encoding, Data Cleaning
💾 Deployment-ready: Uses saved_steps.pkl to store the trained model and encoders

This project helped me deepen my understanding of:

Model integration in web apps

Real-world data preprocessing

Interactive dashboards with user input
